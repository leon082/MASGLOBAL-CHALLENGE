# MASGLOBAL-CHALLENGE
You'll find here two projects, one of them is the backend layer (backend.challenge.masglobal), built with java and using spring boot. In the other one (leon-project),  you could find the frontend layer using Angular.
In each one of them you'll find a README file with the instrucctions to run the specific application.

Please remember: To run the frontend,  BACKEND MUST BE RUNNING!
